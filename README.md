## What is Corelia?

Corelia is an open-source AI platform designed to transform unstructured French medical reports into structured, actionable insights. Built specifically for French healthcare, it leverages advanced natural language processing to extract medical entities and map them to ICD-10-FR codes, ensuring compliance and data sovereignty.

## The Problem

Each year, over 80% of medical notes generated in French hospitals remain as unstructured text that cannot be exploited - representing more than 50 million annual documents whose medical, administrative, and epidemiological value remains largely underutilized.

## Our Solution

Corelia provides a sovereign AI platform that:

- **Enhances** unstructured medical reports into clean, standardized formats
- **Extracts** medical entities using specialized French-trained models  
- **Maps** entities to ICD-10-FR codes for regulatory compliance
- **Reduces** manual coding time by 50-70%
