## What is Corelia?

Corelia is a research project exploring how to create a **French BioMistral** - a specialized medical LLM for French healthcare. While BioMistral excels in English medical applications, there's no equivalent for French medicine, creating a significant gap in the French healthcare AI ecosystem.

## Our Research Approach

We're leveraging multiple open-source French medical data sources from the web to build the largest French medical corpus ever assembled. This comprehensive dataset will be used for continual pre-training of Mistral-7B, creating a model that truly understands French medical terminology, healthcare system specifics, and clinical reasoning patterns.

**Why this matters**: Beyond being a capstone project, this research has significant potential for advancing French medical AI and contributing to sovereign healthcare technology.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spideystreet/corelia.git
cd corelia
uv sync
```
