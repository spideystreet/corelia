# Project Overview

## What is Corelia?

Corelia is an AI-powered medical note processing pipeline designed to transform unstructured medical reports into structured, actionable insights. The project focuses on French medical text processing and aims to become the reference solution for medical AI in France.

## The Problem

Each year, over 80% of notes generated in hospitals remain as unstructured text that cannot be exploited - representing more than 50 million annual documents whose medical, administrative, and epidemiological value remains largely underutilized. This situation continues to hinder the National Health Data System (SNDS), public research, and healthcare facility performance.

## Our Solution

Corelia provides an AI platform trained, deployed, and governed in France to significantly simplify the administrative management of healthcare facilities.

### Core Features

The platform offers three primary capabilities that address the core challenges of medical data processing. Medical Report Enhancement transforms medical reports and doctor's notes into clean, AI-exploitable insights through advanced natural language processing. Medical Entity Mapping intelligently maps medical entities to ICD-10-FR codes, ensuring compliance with French healthcare standards. Automated Processing streamlines the entire pipeline from raw text to structured data, eliminating manual coding and reducing processing time.

## Strategic Approach

Corelia addresses the French medical AI gap through a comprehensive three-stage approach. The platform enhances medical reports using advanced natural language processing, extracts medical entities through specialized French-trained models, and maps these entities to standardized French medical codes. This integrated approach ensures complete compatibility with French healthcare systems while maintaining the highest standards of data sovereignty and privacy protection.

### Key Principles

**French-First Design**: Unlike international competitors that rely on English or poorly adapted corpora, Corelia is specifically designed for French medical complexity and terminology. **Open Source Foundation**: The platform is fully open-source, ensuring transparency, auditability, and community-driven development. **Sovereign Infrastructure**: Built and hosted on French sovereign cloud infrastructure, ensuring complete data sovereignty and compliance with French regulations. **Privacy by Design**: GDPR compliance and data protection are built into the system from the ground up, ensuring patient privacy and regulatory compliance.

## Vision

Corelia aims to become the reference building block for French medical AI: free, efficient, evolutive, and faithful to the general interest. The platform will transform every medical report written in hospitals into a sovereign and exploitable resource for better care, prevention, and management.
