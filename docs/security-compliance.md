# Security & Compliance Considerations

## Looking Ahead: Future Compliance Requirements

While Corelia is currently a research project, we're already thinking about the regulatory landscape that would apply if this technology were to be deployed in real healthcare settings. Understanding these requirements from the start helps us design our research with future applications in mind.

## EU AI Act: High-Risk Classification

If deployed in healthcare applications, Corelia would likely fall under the **High Risk** category of the EU AI Act due to its potential medical decision-making capabilities:

</div>

This classification would require comprehensive risk management, data governance frameworks, technical documentation, and human oversight mechanisms - all considerations we're keeping in mind as we develop our research methodology.

## Data Protection & Privacy

**GDPR & CNIL Compliance**: Any future deployment would need to adhere to strict French data protection regulations. Our current research approach already prioritizes privacy by design, using only publicly available medical content and ensuring no patient data is involved.

**Data Sovereignty**: For future applications, we envision deployment on French-controlled infrastructure like OVH's SecNumCloud, ensuring complete data sovereignty and compliance with French healthcare data hosting requirements (HDS certification).

## Research Ethics & Transparency

Our current research prioritizes transparency and responsible AI development. We document all data sources, respect website terms of service, and maintain clear attribution to content creators. This ethical foundation will be crucial for any future healthcare applications.

**Current Status**: This is a research project in development. The security and compliance considerations outlined here represent our forward-thinking approach to responsible AI development, preparing for potential future applications in French healthcare.
