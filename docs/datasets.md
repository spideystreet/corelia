# Data Sources & Strategy

## Open-Source Medical Data Foundation

Our research builds upon multiple open-source French medical data sources, including comprehensive collections of medical documents from government health agencies, medical institutions, research papers, and administrative documents. These sources provide a solid foundation for understanding French medical language patterns.

## Expanding Coverage Through Web Crawling

To ensure we capture the full spectrum of French medical content, we supplement our data sources with targeted web crawling techniques. Our approach targets authoritative French medical websites across different categories:

**Government Sources**: sante.gouv.fr, ansm.sante.fr, drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr, etc.  
**Medical Institutions**: e-cancer.fr, agence-biomedecine.fr, efs.sante.fr, etc.  
**Health Services**: msa.fr, alcool-info-service.fr, drogues-info-service.fr, etc.

## Data Processing Approach

The collected content undergoes a rigorous processing pipeline: text extraction from various formats, quality filtering to remove irrelevant content, French medical terminology normalization, and deduplication to ensure data quality.

## Research Ethics & Licensing

All data sources respect open data principles and website terms of service. Our approach prioritizes transparency and responsible data usage throughout the research process, ensuring compliance with licensing requirements and ethical data collection practices.
