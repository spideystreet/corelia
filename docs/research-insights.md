## Why Mistral-7B Over Biomedical Models

### The Performance Paradox

Recent 2025 research reveals that **fine-tuning biomedical models often degrades performance** on real-world clinical tasks. A study comparing 12 biomedically adapted models found that **11 out of 12 exhibited performance declines** on clinical language understanding.

### The Language Problem

**BioMistral-7B** performs well on English medical tasks but is optimized for English processing, creating a mismatch for French healthcare systems:

- French medical terminology follows different conventions
- Clinical documentation uses French medical vocabulary
- Regulatory compliance requires French language processing
- Cultural context affects medical communication patterns

### Why Mistral-7B is Optimal

**Mistral-7B** offers superior advantages for French medical text:

#### 1. Native French Capabilities
- Trained on French text from the ground up
- Superior French medical terminology understanding
- Cultural context awareness for French healthcare

#### 2. Performance Excellence
General-domain models often outperform specialized biomedical models on complex clinical tasks:
