## Why We Chose Mistral-7B Over Biomedical Models

### The Biomedical Model Performance Paradox

Recent research from 2025 reveals a critical finding: **fine-tuning biomedical models often degrades performance** on real-world clinical tasks. A comprehensive study comparing 12 biomedically adapted models with their general-domain counterparts found that **11 out of 12 biomedical models exhibited performance declines** on clinical language understanding tasks.

### The Language Limitation Problem

While models like **BioMistral-7B** show impressive performance on English medical tasks, they are **essentially optimized for English language processing**. This creates a fundamental mismatch for French healthcare systems where medical terminology follows French conventions, clinical documentation uses French medical vocabulary, regulatory compliance requires French language processing, and cultural context affects medical communication patterns.

### Why Mistral-7B is the Optimal Choice

Our research demonstrates that **Mistral-7B** offers superior advantages for French medical text processing:

#### 1. Native French Language Capabilities
Mistral-7B is trained on French text from the ground up, providing superior French medical terminology understanding and cultural context awareness for French healthcare communication.

#### 2. Performance Excellence
Recent benchmarks show that general-domain models often outperform specialized biomedical models on complex clinical tasks, particularly for larger model architectures:

#### 3. Regulatory Compliance Advantage
Mistral-7B's French origin provides significant regulatory benefits under the EU AI Act 2025. As a French sovereign model, it reduces regulatory complexity while ensuring data sovereignty compliance for sensitive medical data. Transparency requirements are more easily met with French-developed models, and risk assessment is simplified for French healthcare applications.
